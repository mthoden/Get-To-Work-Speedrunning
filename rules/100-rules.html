								<section>
									<h2>Generic</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>All runs require permanent uninterrupted video proof in which no significant portion of the screen is obstructed and game audio is audible at all times.</li>
										<li>Timing must be done using the In-Game Timer (IGT)</li>
										<li>Entering a save file created outside of the run is banned</li>
										<li>Using cheats or debug features during a run is banned</li>
										<li>Altering game files in any way is banned</li>
										<li>Use of any third-party programs which directly affect the game are banned, with the exception of software that caps your framerate such as RivaTuner (This includes rebinding software)</li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Category Specific</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Timing starts upon creation of a new game when the In-Game Timer begins</li>
										<li>Timing ends when you have collected both hats, collected all 19 podcasts, accomplished the Billionaire ending and the In-Game Timer stops</li>
										<li>You may not quit out during a run, all runs must be completed in one go. You can however pause as long as it isn't to an egregious degree</li>
										<li>If a glitch occurs unintentionally and does not affect the speed of the run, it will be considered allowed; this is subject to change at moderators discretion based on the severity of the glitch</li>
										<li>Bypassing walls or accessing areas out of bounds <strong>is not</strong> allowed</li>
										<li>Grabbing onto physics objects to launch yourself <strong>is not</strong> allowed</li>
										<li>Abusing game mechanics to ragdoll and skip significant portions of the game <strong>is not</strong> allowed. (i.e. jump pad ragdolling)</li>
										<li>Wall climbing is allowed</li>
										<li>Grabbing onto the sides of launchers to be sent in unintended directions is allowed</li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Framerate</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Although not required, it is highly encouraged that frame rate always be shown to avoid recategorization of your run. Rivatuner / Steam Overlay or other similar software works fine for this. FPS can be capped in-game by using the "exclusive full screen" mode; however, your method of capping FPS does not matter</li>
										<li><strong>45/60 FPS:</strong> Framerate must be displayed and stay within 45 and 60 FPS for the entire duration of the run</li>
										<li><strong>60 FPS:</strong> Framerate must be displayed and stay exclusively at 60 FPS for the entire duration of the run</li>
										<li><strong>No FPS:</strong> No FPS Display Framerate must not intentionally go below 45 FPS for the entire duration of the run. This will be enforced on a case by case basis. If your run is suspected of using tech exclusive to low FPS categories (such as Any%) it may be recategorized</li>
